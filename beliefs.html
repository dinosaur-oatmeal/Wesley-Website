                    <p>
                        We affirm God revealed to us in three persons— God the Creator, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit— created all things.
                        God is all good, all powerful, and all knowing, who seeks to be in relationship with that creation.

                        We affirm the incarnation of Christ, the mystery of God’s salvific work in this world, who was fully human and fully divine, and through whose life, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension we are graciously afforded life eternal.
                        Through relationship with the Risen Christ, we are afforded an opportunity to live into God’s plan for the forgiveness of sin and the life everlasting.

                        We affirm the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives, working in ways seen and unseen to lead us toward God, to know God’s will, and to sense God’s presence and love, always knowing we are not alone.

                        We believe in the centrality of the Holy Scriptures for our faith and practice.
                        We believe God can and does speak to us through scripture, enabling us to better understand Jesus Christ and feel the Holy Spirit move within our being.
                        The message of God revealed to us through the Bible articulates all things necessary for our relationship with God and the eternal disposition of our immortal souls.

                        We understand God’s reign as both now and present, and that which is to come.
                        It is the understanding of God’s work in our lives today that draws us toward the culmination of God’s plan in the future, into whose creation we are called to participate.

                        We as followers of Christ are called be active in the ministry of God’s Good News to the world around us through our actions as the church.
                        We believe when we come together as one body, collaborating with the Creator in this world that God loves, the fullness of the Reign of God draws nearer.

                        As a <a href="https://www.umc.org/en/">United Methodist</a>, we are shaped by the teachings of John Wesley.
                        Through his leadership, we understand the centrality of scripture within the Christian faith as supported by the traditions of the church, our God-given human reasoning, and the experience of God transforming us all.

                <div class="mission-statement">
                    <p>
                        We believe that scripture holds out an understanding that God desires to be in relationship with all people.
                        It is through that relationship that God’s transforming presence would be experienced.
                        The UTA Wesley is a radically inclusive space were people of all nations, races, genders, orientations, citizenship statuses, political affiliations, economic condition, and theological understandings are invited together into worship and service.
                        Each person, as a beloved creation of God, will be treated with dignity, respect, kindness, and love.
